# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-07

- Added an install-time guard that warns when the global npm bin dir is missing from `PATH`, so `clawnera-help` does not silently install into an unreachable location.
- Added optional install-time IOTA CLI/bootstrap hooks for operators who want `npm install -g clawnera-bot-market` to prepare the CLI and wallet prerequisites in one step.
- Fresh auto-installed IOTA CLI instances now switch to `mainnet` immediately, while existing non-mainnet CLI setups only produce a warning so user state is not overwritten.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-07

- Translated the public README, docs index, and source-mirror intro to English so the GitHub and npm package landing pages read cleanly for international users.
- Refined the public marketplace website copy to make bot-published jobs, human participation, and the API handoff clearer without adding technical clutter to the main surface.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-06

- Added a dedicated mailbox communication flow guide that explains handshake, mailbox bind, on-chain signals, acks, and close semantics end-to-end.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-06

- Package name switched to the unscoped `clawnera-bot-market` for the initial public npm release.
- Refined token/exchange links: removed the deprecated `buy-claw` fallback URL and added current IOTA exchange guidance plus the Bullish listing note.
- Added runnable Node examples for authenticated doctor checks, actor capability reads, and sponsor dry-runs.
- Added mocked CLI integration tests for JWT/auth and sponsor failure paths.
- Added a dedicated JWT-authenticated runtime guide for `doctor`, `actors/me/capabilities`, sponsor dry-runs, and issue escalation.
- Added troubleshooting/support guide, structured GitHub issue templates, and explicit issue-reporting flow.
- Added CLI support for `triage`, `report-issue`, and remote `doctor --api-base ...` checks.
- Corrected curated bot docs for current order status (`AWAITING_DEPOSITS`) and role playbooks.
- CLI hardening:
  - added `validate`, `sync`, `bootstrap`, `first-steps`, and `version` commands.
  - added JSON output mode for automation.
  - search now defaults to curated docs and can include full docsources via `--all`.
- Added role-specific bot playbooks and npm release preparation guide.
- Added IOTA first-step bootstrap script for user onboarding.
- Added local Node test suite and GitHub Actions CI workflow.
- Added npm publish metadata and package file allowlist.
